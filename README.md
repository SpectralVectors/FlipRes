# FlipRes
Flips the X/Y render resolution: Landscape to Portrait and back

# What It Is
This addon adds a convenient button to the Output > Format panel in Blender's Properties editor.

With a single click it will swap your X and Y resolution, allowing you to quickly switch between Landscape and Portrait modes without rotating your camera or render.
